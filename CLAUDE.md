# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

There is no test suite configured in this repo.

## Architecture

This is a Next.js 15 App Router admin dashboard (Aakdi/AQDI) for managing real-estate contracts, orders, employees, and site content. UI is RTL Arabic (`lang="ar" dir="rtl"` in [src/app/layout.js](src/app/layout.js)).

### Two parallel root directories via the same `@/*` alias

`tsconfig.json`/`jsconfig.json` map `@/*` to the repo root, and **both** `src/` and root-level `components/`/`lib/` exist side by side:

- `@/components/*` → root `components/` (feature UI + shadcn primitives in `components/ui/`)
- `@/lib/*` → root `lib/` (`lib/utils.js` — shadcn `cn()` helper, `lib/i18n.js`)
- `@/src/*` → `src/` (`stores`, `hooks`, `lib` (permissions/business logic), `Context`, `utils`)
- `@/app/*` → `src/app/` implicitly via the same alias (Next App Router lives at `src/app`)

Don't assume one `lib` or one `components` dir — check whether an import is `@/lib/...` (root) vs `@/src/lib/...` (src) before editing.

### Data fetching

- All HTTP calls go through `axiosInstance` in [src/utils/axios.js](src/utils/axios.js). It auto-attaches the Bearer token from `useUserStore`/localStorage and force-logs-out + redirects to `/login` on a 401.
- Client-side base URL is same-origin `/api`; `next.config.mjs` rewrites `/api/:path*` to `API_PROXY_TARGET` (defaults to `https://aqid.subcodeco.com/api`). Server-side (no `window`) falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` from `.env`.
- Data fetching/mutations use TanStack React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`). The provider is `ReactQueryProvider` ([src/utils/providers/ReactQueryProvider.jsx](src/utils/providers/ReactQueryProvider.jsx)), wired in `src/app/layout.js`. Feature-specific query/mutation hooks live in `src/hooks/*` (e.g. `useGetHome.js`, `use-paperworks.js`).
- Prefer adding a `use*` hook in `src/hooks/` over calling `axiosInstance` directly from a component/page.

### Auth & permissions

- Auth state (`user`, `token`, `isAuthenticated`) lives in a persisted Zustand store: `src/stores/user-store.js` (localStorage-backed, `skipHydration: true`, hydrated manually — see `_hasHydrated`).
- `src/app/actions/auth.js` is a `'use server'` module that sets/removes an auth cookie (readable by middleware); the Zustand store is the client-side source of truth and stays in sync with it.
- Permission model lives entirely in [src/lib/permissions.js](src/lib/permissions.js): permissions are normalized to `"section.action"` strings (e.g. `orders.view`) from various API shapes (`permissions`, `permission_names`, `permission_matrix`, role-nested variants). `isSuperAdmin` short-circuits on role name (`admin`/`مدير النظام`), `is_super_admin`, or a `'*'` permission.
- `ROUTE_SECTION_RULES` maps URL prefixes to required permission sections (longest-prefix wins); `SIDEBAR_NAV` drives the sidebar and doubles as the permission-aware nav source. When adding a new `/home/*` route that needs gating, add both a `ROUTE_SECTION_RULES` entry and a `SIDEBAR_NAV` item.
- `src/hooks/usePermissions.js` is the main consumption point (`can()`, `canRoute()`, `isAdmin`, `firstAllowedHref`) and lazily fetches the user's role permissions via React Query if the login payload didn't include them.
- `components/auth/RoutePermissionGuard.jsx` wraps protected pages: it waits for store hydration, redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`, and redirects unauthorized users to `firstAllowedHref` with a toast.

### Route structure

Feature pages live under `src/app/home/<feature>/page.jsx` (one directory per sidebar item — `orders`, `employees`, `roles`, `salaries`, `settings`, `content/home`, `content/about`, the various `*-analysis` sections, etc.), with `[id]/page.jsx` for detail views. Corresponding non-page components (forms, tables, cards) live in root `components/<Feature>/...`, mirrored by feature name (e.g. `components/content/home/*-section-form.jsx` for `src/app/home/content/home`).

### Forms

Forms use `react-hook-form` + `@hookform/resolvers` (zod) + shadcn `components/ui/form.jsx`. Content-admin forms (`components/content/**/*-form.jsx`) follow a pattern of: React Query fetch for initial data → populate the form → submit as `FormData` (for file/image uploads) via a mutation. Shared helpers for that flow (endpoint map, asset/preview shaping) are in `src/lib/content-admin.js`.

### Rich text & documents

TipTap (`@tiptap/*`) is used for rich-text editing; `jspdf`, `xlsx`, `html2canvas`/`dom-to-image` are used for exporting contracts/reports.

### UI kit

shadcn/ui ("new-york" style, `components.json`) generates into `components/ui/*`, aliased as `@/components/ui`. Icons: `lucide-react` (shadcn default) and `react-icons`/FontAwesome elsewhere in the app. Styling is Tailwind (`tailwind.config.js`) with `styled-components` and Bootstrap/`react-bootstrap` also present in some legacy areas — check the surrounding file before picking a styling approach.
